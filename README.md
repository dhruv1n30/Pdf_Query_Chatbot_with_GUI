## Setting Up Your Environment

To run this PDF chatbot, you'll need a virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.7+ (Check version: `python --version` in your terminal.)
- `venv` module included with Python 3.3+ ([Link to instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))

**Steps:**

1. **Open a terminal/command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to your project directory:** Use `cd <path_to_project_directory>`.
3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   - PowerShell: `python -m venv myenv`
   - CMD: `python -m venv myenv` (Replace `myenv` with your desired name.)
4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - PowerShell: `.\myenv\Scripts\activate`
   - CMD: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
5. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Download `requirements.txt` if not present.)

**Troubleshooting:**

- If `venv` is missing, install it using `pip install virtualenv` within the activated virtual environment.
- For issues with Python version or `pip` installation, refer to the documentation.

**Running the Chatbot:**

1. **Within the activated virtual environment:**
2. **Run the command:** `streamlit run deployment.py`
